# Federal Job Insider Resume Analyzer
## Summary

This is one of my early AngularJS Projects.

It is a web based tool created to help a client automate their free first pass resume critiques. The manual process required that they compare a prospective customer’s resume to a job posting. They identified this as a high cost, low return task necessary to generate sales leads.

The resume analyzer tool automatically pulls in the job description from a job posting, then sends it to a natural language recognition system to identify keywords. It then compares these results to the customer’s resume, and rates it based upon keyword coverage.

This tool saved the client approx 30 mins per sales lead, helping to decrease their customer acquisition cost.
